# ML_Test_Score_Analysis
Problem Statement:

the data description :

Batch - Represents the Batch Name

User_ID - Represents the unique student id

Score - Represents the Score out of 7

Download the data from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5cLgsku0WUiEupuSIaNWhH3aKpo7shp/view?usp=sharing

Note that this is an open-ended problem. You are supposed to give me insights about the three different batches for which the score data has been provided to you.
